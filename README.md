# Finitio.js

Finitio is a language for capturing information structure. A little bit like
"JSON/XML schema" but on steroids. An example is show below. For more
information about Finitio itself, see [www.finitio.io](http://www.finitio.io)

```finitio
@import finitio/data

Uuid = String( s | s =~ /^[a-z0-9-]{36}$/ )
Name = String( s | s.length > 0 )
Temp = <celsius> Real( f | f >= 33.0 && f <= 45.0 )
{
  patient : {
    id   : Uuid
    name : Name
    dob  : Date( d | alive: d.year > 1890 )
  }
  symptoms : [ String( s | s.size > 0 ) ]
  temperature : Temp
}
```

Finitio.js is the javascript binding of Finitio. It allows defining
schemas and validating/coercing data against them in an idiomatic javascript
way.

## Features

Finitio.js is a stable and mature implementation conforming to
[Finitio 0.4](http://www.finitio.io/reference/0.4.x/). It also comes with the
following tooling:

* A `finitio-js` command line for validating data from a shell
* A bundler for preparing schemas and systems for use in a browser
* Nice error management strategy with understandable messages & stacks
* Try it online, at [http://finitio.io/try](finitio.io/try)
* A standard library, especially `finitio/data` for dressing numbers, dates
  times without pain, despite JavaScript weaknesses in that regard
* Experimental undressing strategy

## Getting started in Shell

* Validating data against as schema and showing all errors

    `finitio-js -v schema.fio data.json`

* Better understanding where validation errors come from

    `finitio-js --stack -v schema.fio data.json`

* Fail fast option (stop on first validation error)

    `finitio-js --stack --fast -v schema.fio data.json`

* Compiling a schema for the browser

    `finitio-js -c schema.fio`

## Getting started in JavaScript

Roughly, getting started with finitio.js in JavaScript code works as follows:

```javascript
var Finitio = require('../index.js');

// Parses a schema and compiles to a System object
var schema = "                              \n\
Name = String( s | nonEmpty: s.length>0 )   \n\
[{ who: Name }]                             \n\
"
var system = Finitio.system(schema);

// Some data, with invalid tuples according to the schema above
var data = [
  { who: 'Finitio' },
  { who: 'JavaScript' },
  { who: '' },
  { who: 12 }
];

// dress/validate some data
try {
  system.dress(data);
} catch (ex) {
  // explain the validation errors
  // `explainTree` can be used for better debugging
  console.log(ex.explain());
}
```

## Imports and Standard Library

Since Finitio 0.4, imports are supported to split complex schemas in multiple
files. A standard library has also been started, from which you can import
too.

```finitio
# import types from utils.fio and ../support/tools.fio into this schema
@import ./utils
@import ../support/tools

# import from the standard library
@import finitio/data

# import from the web
@import http://my-finitio-schemas.org/somewhere/somefile
```

Refer to Finitio's web site for more documentation about
[imports](http://www.finitio.io/reference/0.4.x/imports) and the
[standard library](http://www.finitio.io/reference/0.4.x/stdlib).

## Bundling schemas (for the browser)

Complex finitio schemas can also be bundled as one self-contained javascript
file. The bundling process does not (yet) make schemas independent of
finitio.js itself (i.e. finitio is still a runtime dependency). However,
bundling can be used for:

* Checking the validity of your schema ahead of test & runtime time
* Avoiding costly parsing at runtime
* Avoiding the import resolution mechanism to occur at runtime, by bundling
  all dependencies in one file, including schemas from the standard library
  and the web.
* Making your schema ready in the browser, in particular not dependent of the
  file system (for relative imports).

Bundling can be done from a shell, as follows (the --fast option is just used
to stop on the first schema error):

```shell
finitio-js --fast --bundle schema.fio
```

This will generate a javascript bunch of code. This code, when evaluated
returns a function that can be injected with the world to obtain the
compiled schema (see more about the world later). In practice:

```javascript
var schemaCompiler = require('generated-finitio-bundle.js');
var system = schemaCompiler();
system.dress({ some: 'data' });
```

In the scenario above, the schemaCompiler will require finitio by itself.
In some situations, such as when you use external javascript references,
however, you will need to pass a world instance for it to work properly.
This is explained in the next section.

## Advanced scenarios and the World concept

Finitio relies on a World concept for:

* Resolving external references at compile time, (e.g. JavaScript's
  String, Number, Regexp or your own 'classes' when using ADTs), i.e. when you
  call `Finitio.system`.
* Resolving `@import`s
* Managing dressing options, e.g. `failfast`

In simple scenarios you won't need to hack with the world concept. However,
for advanced usage of Finitio, understanding the `world` argument taken by
many citizen is important. Those citizen are:

* `Finitio.system(source, world)` (e.g. for resolving builtins and ADTs)
* `Finitio.compile(source, world)` (idem, when compiling for the browser)
* `Type.dress(value, world)` (to make the world available to native information contracts)
* `System.dress(value, world)` (idem, delegated to main type)

### Resolving external references at compile time

The first scenario is the most frequent, where the world is used to resolve
extenal references. Finitio has a default world that already resolves
references to JavaScript main constants such as `Number` of `String`. Your
world, providing references to you own 'classes' will be merged with the
default one:

```javascript
// your own abstractions
var MyLibrary = { Color: function(){ } };

// you need to provide external references in world's JsTypes
var world = { JsTypes: { 'MyJsColor': MyLibrary.Color } };

// the world will be use to resolve `.MyJsColor` below. `.String` is already
// resolved by the default world
var system = Finitio.system("Color = .MyJsColor <as> .String", world);
```

### Passing options at dressing time

The following options can be set to the World when dressing & validating
data:

* `failfast`: When true, stops dressing as soon as a first validation error
  is found. When false (default), dressing will collect all errors before
  failing. The default option may be costly on complex schema, as it keeps
  the entire failure tree.

### Hacking in native information contracts

The world can also be used in internal and external information contracts.
This is not recommended, as it means that you dresser have side effects, but
it might be useful sometimes.

As an example, suppose that you have a global registry with elements as
follows (that might be a database, or the file system or whatever):

```javascript
var Registry = {
  1: { foo: 'bar' },
  2: { bar: 'baz' }
};
```

Maybe you want to provide an information contract for resolving ids to actual
data through that registry. Finitio does not allow you to do it with explicit
contracts, you want be able to resolve ids that way:

```finitio
Component = .Object <id> .Number \( id | ??? )
```

In contract, native contracts receive the world as second argument, meaning
that following scenario will work:

```javascript
var ComponentContract = {
  dress: function(id, world){
    var resolved = world.TheRegistry[id];
    if (resolved){
      return resolved;
    } else {
      throw new Error("No such component");
    }
  }
}
```

At compile time:

```javascript
var world  = { JsTypes: { ComponentContract: ComponentContract }};
var schema = 'Component = .Object <id> .Number .ComponentContract';
var system = Finitio.system(schema, world);
```

At dressing time:

```javascript
var world   = { TheRegistry: Registry };
var dressed = system.Component.dress(2, world);
```

## More on Internal Information Contracts

Abstract Data Types can be defined and dressed using Finitio.js, provided you
register them as show previously. Let take the usual `Color` example. (We
"qualify" type names below only to avoid confusion, in practice, one would
probably use `Color` everywhere.)

In Finitio,

```finitio
Byte  = .Number // should be defined more accurately, of course
Color = .JsColor <rgb> { r: Byte, g: Byte, b: Byte }
```

In Javascript,

```javascript
Color = function(r, g, b) {
  this.r = r;
  this.g = g;
  this.b = b;
}
Color.rgb = function(tuple) {
  return new Color(tuple.r, tuple.g, tuple.b);
}
Color.prototype.toRgb = function(color){
  return {
    r: color.r,
    g: color.g,
    b: color.b
  };
}
```

At compile time:

```javascript
schema = "..." // as shown above

// you must let Finitio.js know about JsColor, in the following way
system = Finitio.system(schema, { JsTypes: { JsColor: Color } });

// dressing will then work as expected
color = system.Color.dress({r: 12, g: 125, b: 98});
```

## More on External Information Contracts

Finitio.js also allows defining so-called 'external' information contracts for
situations where implementing the dresser and undresser functions as show
above is not possible or not wanted.

In Finitio,

```finitio
Byte  = .Number // should be defined more accurately, of course
Color = .JsColor <rgb> { r: Byte, g: Byte, b: Byte } .ExternalContract
```

In Javascript,

```javascript
Color = function(r, g, b) {
  this.r = r;
  this.g = g;
  this.b = b;
}
ColorContract = {
  dress: function(tuple) {
    return new Color(tuple.r, tuple.g, tuple.b);
  },
  undress: function(color) {
    return {
      r: color.r,
      g: color.g,
      b: color.b
    };
  }
}
```

At compile time:

```javascript
schema = "..." // as shown above

// you must let Finitio.js know about ExternalContract, in the following way
system = Finitio.system(schema, { JsTypes: { ExternalContract: ColorContract } });

// dressing will then work as expected
color = system.Color.dress({r: 12, g: 125, b: 98});
```

## Representation of Finitio Types as JavaScript types

The `Rep` representation function mapping Finitio types to Javascript types is
as follows:

```
# Any is anything in javascript
Rep(.) = any javascript value/object/stuff

# Builtins are represented by the corresponding javascript type
# Supported: Number, String, Boolean, Date and your own abstractions (see below)
Rep(.Builtin) = Builtin

# Sub types are represented by the same representation as the super type
Rep(SuperType( s | ... )) = Rep(SuperType)

# Unions are represented by the corresponding javascript types. No guaranteed
# result in terms of types, as `^` (least common super type) is difficult to
# define properly in javascript.
Rep(T1 | ... | Tn) = Rep(T1) ^ ... ^ Rep(Tn)

# Sequences are represented through javascript Arrays.
Rep([ElmType]) = Array<Rep(ElmType)>

# Sets are represented through javascript Arrays. _Finitio.js_ checks for duplicates,
# though.
Rep({ElmType}) = Array<Rep(ElmType)>

# Tuples are represented through standard javascript objects.
Rep({Ai => Ti}) = Object<{Ai: Rep(Ti)}>

# Relations are represented through Arrays of objects.
Rep({{Ai => Ti}}) = Array<Object<Ai => Rep(Ti)>>

# Abstract data types are represented through the corresponding javascript
# type when specified. ADTs behave as Union types if no type is bound.
Rep(.Builtin <rep> ...) = Builtin
```
